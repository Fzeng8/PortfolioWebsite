                <h4>About the Project</h4>
                <p>Alone is an <strong>augmented reality</strong> virtual exhibition inspired by <a href="https://twitter.com/GOT7Official/status/1311501086746836993" target="_blank">Defsoul's first exhibition with the same name</a> in Seoul from October 6-12, 2020. Due to the pandemic and short exhibition time, many fans of Def were unable to visit his exhibition. This <strong>iOS app</strong> gives users the opportunity to view Def's gallery anywhere around the world regardless of the circumstances.<br><br>
                    I coded this project in <strong>Xcode</strong> using <strong>Swift</strong> with Apple's <strong>ARKit</strong> and <strong>RealityKit</strong>. I also used <strong>Premiere Pro</strong> to make the <strong>video</strong> assets.</p>

For the captions, I referenced the translations by Twitter account <a href="https://twitter.com/defdaily_/status/1313349561117667328" target="_blank">defdaily.</a><br><br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2ZeP6q5iFyaCyGpULdl5TAHta2rGrjeb" target="_blank">View the Playlist of Video Textures Here</a></p>

                <h4>Storytelling</h4>
                <p>For his songwriting process, Defsoul arranges photo to create stories that inspires his songs. Since Def uses photography for storytelling, I wanted to add that into the Alone app.<br><br>There are two different story modes for the users to try out. The first is Def's Story where the photo order and elements of the exhibition design is predetermined and always the same. The second is Your Story where the photo order and elements of the exhibition design is completely randomized, so each time the exhibition will be different. <span class="bold">This is to encourage users to create their own connections and stories with the photos.</span>
                    <br><br>Elements of the exhibition design includes scale of the media cubes, distance from camera the media cubes are placed, which face the media cube lands on, and the speed the media cubes are sent out.</p>

                <h4>User Interface & User Experience</h4>
                <p>For the UI, I kept with simple rounded buttons at the bottom of the screen. The rounded buttons contrast the blocky type of the Alone logo and the button placement is for easy access with the user's thumb.<br><br>For the UX, I had a photo in the center of the screen that told users what the next photo was which would help them decide the placement of the next media cube. I also had instructions during the experience to encourage users to walk around and explore the gallery space.</p>

                <h4>Next Steps</h4>
                <p>I really like the concept of this AR project, and although I am proud of what Alone looks like right now, I want to explore this concept further. I want to add particle systems into the exhibition space to help set the mood more. Maybe I can use my own photography in this AR format or even work with Defsoul? (If anyone that sees this knows Defsoul, please let me know. I would love to pitch this to him!)<br><br><span class="bold">The concept I want to explore the most is using other 3D shapes and objects besides the cube.</span> The rectangular faces of the media cube is very traditional and typical of photography, but with technology, it is possible to texture any 3D objects with the photos. I experimented with other shapes, like the sphere, or objects that are related to Def's photography, like the umbrella. I would love explore how photography is viewed different when it is placed over shapes other than the rectangle.</p>
