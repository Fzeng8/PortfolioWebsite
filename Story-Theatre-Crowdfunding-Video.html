                <h4>About the Project</h4>
                <p><a href="https://www.classacts.cz/storytheatre" target="_blank">Story Theatre</a> is a children's English theatre group in Prague co-founded by Leah Gaffen. They were planning a crowdfunding campaign to make professional recordings and CD's of their award-winning musical <span class="italics">Journeys</span>. I worked closely with Leah on this video during my <strong>Prague study abroad</strong> in the Spring of 2020. Although my time in Europe was cut short by COVID, I continued to work with the theatre group to finish this crowdfunding video. For this project, I helped out with <strong>scriptwriting, interviewing,</strong> and <strong>video editing in Premiere Pro</strong>.</p>

                <h4>Video Production and Editing</h4>
                <p>Although most of the video was made using existing footage captured by the theatre group during prior shows, I did help with filming additional scenes for the crowdfunding video. When Story Theatre were meeting to record for their songs, I filmed B-roll footage, and I conducted and recorded interviews with people involved in <span class="italics">Journeys</span>. On a separate occasion, I also helped record Leah's voiceovers and her scenes at the beginning and end of the video.</p>

                <p>The crowdfunding campaign was hosted on Hithit, a Czech crowdfunding site. Story Theatre's campaign was fully funded in just six days, and by the end, was 133% funded. Through this campaign, they were able to produce CD's of the songs in <span class="italics">Journeys</span> and start funding their next performance, <span class="italics">A Star is Falling</span> which is about Communist Czechoslovakia.</p>
