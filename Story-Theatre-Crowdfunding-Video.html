                <h4>About the Project</h4>
                <p><a href="https://www.classacts.cz/storytheatre" target="_blank">Story Theatre</a> is a children's English theatre group in Prague co-founded by Leah Gaffen. They were planning a crowdfunding campaign to make professional recordings and CDs of their award-winning musical <span class="italics">Journeys</span>. I worked closely with Leah on this video during my <strong>Prague study abroad</strong> in the Spring of 2020. Although my time in Europe was cut short by COVID, I continued to work with the theatre group to finish this crowdfunding video. For this project, I helped out with <strong>scriptwriting, interviewing,</strong> and <strong>video editing in Premiere Pro</strong>.</p>

                <h4>Interviewing and Video Editing</h4>
                <p><strong>For SCD's branding, I wanted to keep it playful and simple to reflect the designs of the earrings and SCD's hope of bringing a pop of color into the audience's daily life.</strong> I also wanted to use colors from sunsets and cherries, such as reds, blues, and greens, to reinforce the name of the shop.<br><br>After playing around with different designs and typefaces, I decided on a simple cherry logo. The cherry shape is made of a single curvy navy blue line with two offset blobs of color to fill in the cherry leaf and fruit. The curvilinear line and offset color blobs keeps the design playful and carefree. For the typeface, I picked Basic Sans from <strong>Adobe Fonts</strong> because I think it is very clean and minimal, but it still has some subtle flares that match the branding.</p>

                <p>The earrings are made by rolling out slabs of polymer clay and cutting them out with 3D printed cutters. I fully partcipate in every step of this process by <strong>3D modeling and printing</strong> the cutters as well as mixing each clay color and making each clay slab.</p>
