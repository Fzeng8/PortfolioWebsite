                <h4>About the Project</h4>
                <p>This crowdfunding video was made for <a href="https://www.instagram.com/sadboizco/" target="_blank">Sad Boiz Co.</a> a shop I started with my friends. Although this was made for a fake campaign, it follows the format of a real crowdfunding video. The video shares the story of Sad Boiz Co. and features 2D animated characters from the store.<br><br>For this project, I worked through every step of the production process, from script-writing to scheduling filming days to video editing. I filmed parts of this video on a <strong>Sony FS5</strong> and used <strong>Premiere Pro</strong> to edit this video. For the animations, I used an iPad to draw the assets and used <strong>After Effects</strong> to make the animations.</p>

                <h4>Research</h4>
                <p>For my research, I looked at other Kickstarter campaigns that featured a strong brand aesthetic throughout their campaign and sold handmade items similar to Sad Boiz Co. I was most inspired by <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/threegemstea/three-gems-tea">Three Gems Tea's campaign</a> because of how they combined visual branding with the storytelling in their video. I also really liked <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/rchlmade/yourjewelrysucks/">RCHL</a> for their bold visual branding and <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/angelasasser/goddesses-of-autumn-birthstone-and-flower-hard-enamel-pins">Goddesses of Autumn Birthstone and Flower Hard Enamel Pins</a> for their graphics throughout the campaign page.</p>

                <h4>Storytelling</h4>
                <p><strong>I learned that crowdfunding videos are meant to tell stories, not just sell a product the way a traditional commercial does.</strong> The video details Sad Boiz Co.'s origins and creation process, creating an intimate connection with the audience. I also created animations of the store's characters to help with the narration and to add more playfulness into the story.</p>

                <h4>Production</h4>
                <p>I worked through every part of the production process for this video. For pre-production, I researched other crowdfunding videos, created a conceptual treatment, made a storyboard, and wrote the script. For production, I followed my shot list and shooting schedule to film with Sad Boiz Co's co-founders and to shoot people modeling the jewelry. For post-production, I did all the video editing and animations.</p>

                <h4>Animation</h4>
                <p>This video was my first time making a mouth rig and lip-syncing an animation. I taught myself how to make the mouth rig, and although it took a bit of research to understand the different mouth shapes, it quickly became really fun for me.<br><br>The videos above show how the lip-syncing of the animations changed after I made a mouth rig. Without the mouth rig, the animations were pretty funny as they did not match the audio at all. The mouth rig greatly improved the animation and gave the Sad Boiz Co. characters more personality.</p>
